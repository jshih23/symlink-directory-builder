Change Log

SLDB 1.0:
Creates directory in target directory
+GUI - 3 buttons:
+upload keck_file_list - locate your keck_file_list
+select target directory - choose destination directory
+run - create directory @ target directory
+instructions

SLDB 1.2:
Creates directory in auto-created directory
+GUI overhaul, from scratch - new wizard approach
+card 1:
+load... - select your sirius trunk directory
+card 2:
+select a keck_file_list - combobox automatically populated from sirius trunk directory provided in card 1
+run - create directory in /work/SLDB-links-directory
- instructions removed, nobody read them anyways.

SLDB 1.3:
Creates directory in project specific auto created directory
no significant gui changes
+streamlined keck_file_list upload process. 
+Now users are only asked to locate their sirius trunk directory.
+From there, the program searches for keck_file_lists and provides them as options in a combobox.
+run - create directory in /work/SLDB-links-directories/<your project name> - based on keck_file_list
+this allows for the creation of multiple directories, all with unique names.

SLDB 1.4:
+Code fully commented
+Policies filter set up for limo, bugattie, pentane/triptane, and bugatti engines
+Negative logic applied for OBJ_MODULES policies = if it isn't EXCL'uded, it is included.
+Positive logic applied for all other policies = if it isn't INCL'uded, it is excluded.

SLDB 1.4.5:
+Minor bug fixes:
+subsys_pe_policies.mf file wasn't being properly located for policy filtering - FIXED
+commented out System.out.println lines to remove console output. Should speed up runtime by a little bit

SLDB 1.5:
+Major UI changes. Simplified process by assuming /work directory.
-Removed isntructions popup at program finish. Now, the SLDB-links-directories folder located in /work opens automatically.
-Removed load trunk button.
+allows for all keck_file_lists in /work to be located, as opposed to just those in opkgbuild.
+Policy check unchecked by default.
